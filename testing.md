Patrick Testing (My Brother)
-Checked maps at all heights and Widths. (Even on phone) This helped me change my entire design to percentages
-Helped me fix the second page when I didnt have any ideas on how I could make the info smaller and he suggested making it just todays weather
-Checked the third page and told me to fix the size of my images. I then made all of my images 50%
-Checked the final page and made me change my entire camera design and make one picture instead of two. (This helped me make my code a lot simpler than earlier in the semester)
